1)In this implementation, we've chosen to represent a linked list using the names of flowers instead of generic terms like "node". This decision enhances conceptual clarity. Since flower names are utilized as parameters, strings and pointers become pivotal. Employing call by reference simplifies function calls. We've explored various insertion scenarios, particularly addressing the challenge of inserting when the node name is unknown. To handle this, we search for the position using the name associated with the node variable, thereby introducing an additional case for insertion.
