1)Linked list is implemented using flower biological names for better conceptual understanding instead of simply naming them as "nodes". Since flower names are used as parameters, strings play a major role with pointers. Call by reference is used to simplify the calling of the function. Here, I explored insertion with different scenarios, like "what if I am not aware of the node name to insert?". So, searching the position with the node variable's name, hence insertion has another different case
